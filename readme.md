## Synopsis

This will be the beginnings of a dance group's website. My goal for the final is to get a authenticated/unauthenticated user version of the main page and a dance term glossary/lookup. If time permits, set up a song list database similar to foobooks example in class 

## Using so far: 
* foundation for views to get responsive design
* installed msurguy/honeypot to test user verification (ie, prevent spam user signups).

### My checklist
* ~~set up base master and sub view~~
* ~~make tables for users and words~~
* make tables for songs with foreign keys and pivot table
        having trouble with foreign keys pulling up error messages
        foreign keys seem to be triggering error messages
        
* set up models for query for glossary table
* set up query for songs
* get route for user/non user working
        
####after final
* make table for event listings
* make table for linedances
* make table for ratings
* seed tables for users and words
